# -RFID-Based-Passport-Verification-System-using-8051-Microcontroller
This project implements an RFID-based passport verification system that securely authenticates passport holders. The system uses an EM-18 RFID reader interfaced with an 8051 microcontroller to read passport details stored in RFID tags and compare them with stored records. The verification result is displayed on a 16×2 LCD screen.

 **Automation** – Eliminates manual passport verification
 **Security** – Prevents forgery and unauthorized access
 **Efficiency** – Provides real-time, reliable verification


##  Components & Tools

* **Hardware**: 8051 Microcontroller, EM-18 RFID Reader, RFID Tags, 16×2 LCD, Power Supply, Potentiometer, Jumper Wires
* **Software**: Keil µVision (C/ASM programming), Proteus (simulation)

##  Features

* Reads and verifies RFID passport details
* Compares received data with stored records
* Displays **“Passport Verified”** or **“Invalid Passport”** on LCD
* Simulation in **Proteus** and hardware prototype tested
* Can be extended to **access control, library management, toll collection, hospital patient management**, and more

## Working

1. User swipes passport (RFID tag) on RFID reader
2. 8051 receives data and processes it
3. System compares received details with stored records
4. LCD displays verification result (Valid/Invalid)
