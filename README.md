# -RFID-Based-Passport-Verification-System-using-8051-Microcontroller
This project implements an RFID-based passport verification system that securely authenticates passport holders. The system uses an EM-18 RFID reader interfaced with an 8051 microcontroller to read passport details stored in RFID tags and compare them with stored records. The verification result is displayed on a 16Ã—2 LCD screen.
